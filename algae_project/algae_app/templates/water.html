    <p>The data is collected by <a href="http://www.mwa.co.th/">MWA</a> including chemical and biological information between 2012 and 2015. Algal bloom occurs about once a year and tends to be more often and larger in magnitude this caused by waste water discarging from city and heavily use of fertilizer in agricultural processes.

      From our preliminary investigation, conductiveity is over 500umho/cm and turbidity lower than 400 NTU can be used as primary indicator for predicting the algal bloom.</p>
